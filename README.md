# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: **Hafsa Sarker**

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Yes] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [Yes] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [Yes] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [Yes] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Yes] User can search for a specific game and they will be lead right to the games container with that specific game shown
* [Yes] User can click on 'Game' and it will take them to the game-container div right away
* [Yes] Updated the HTML of the header section by using two divs and a flex: 1 in CSS. This was so that the logo and the website title stay together no matter the size of the screen. And then the navigation reference "Game" and the search input box both take equal space as the screen grows / shrinks. As well as the color of the header section.
* [Yes] Updated the company background section to align text to center and highlight the section headers.
* [Yes] Made stats section into combination of divs so that underneath stats, there is a diagram like image to add some visual appeals. 
* [Yes] updated the games section by adding color to the buttons, as well as hover effect (darker button color on hover).

## Notes

    While building this app, I encountered challenges such as positioning each element in the header bar. I set justify content to space-between and the website's log was also seperated from the website title. I fixed this issue using flex: 1. 

    Another problem I encountered was with challenge number 7, it took me a little diging deep to complete the challenge using spreader and destructor.
